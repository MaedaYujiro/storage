  abstract  = {This paper describes a new SAT encoding method, named compact order encoding, applicable to finite domain CSP. It is a generalization of log encoding (compact encoding) and order encoding which is adopted by an award-winning SAT-based CSP solver. The basic idea of the compact order encoding is the use of a numeral system of some base. Each integer variable is divided into some digits and each digit is encoded by using the order encoding. It generates much smaller SAT instances than the order encoding and more efficient SAT instances than the log encoding in general because it requires fewer carry propagations when using larger base than two. We confirmed these observations through the experimental results on some benchmarks, such as Open-Shop Scheduling problems. Especially for very large instances, our solver with MiniSat engine outperformed other encodings and the state-of-the-art CSP solvers choco and Mistral.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new SAT encoding method, named compact order encoding, applicable to finite domain CSP. It is a generalization of log encoding (compact encoding) and order encoding which is adopted by an award-winning SAT-based CSP solver. The basic idea of the compact order encoding is the use of a numeral system of some base. Each integer variable is divided into some digits and each digit is encoded by using the order encoding. It generates much smaller SAT instances than the order encoding and more efficient SAT instances than the log encoding in general because it requires fewer carry propagations when using larger base than two. We confirmed these observations through the experimental results on some benchmarks, such as Open-Shop Scheduling problems. Especially for very large instances, our solver with MiniSat engine outperformed other encodings and the state-of-the-art CSP solvers choco and Mistral.},

For more complex systems, as far as one can tell, the presence of at least one negative loop in the logical structure appears as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a permanent periodic behaviour, and the presence of at least one positive loop as a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for multiple steady states.},

  abstract = {Boolean network models provide an efficient way for studying gene regulatory networks. The main dynamics of a Boolean network is determined by its attractors. Attractor calculation plays a key role for analyzing Boolean gene regulatory networks. An approach of attractor calculation was proposed in this study, which combined the predecessor approach and the logic unsatisfiability approach to accelerate attractor calculation. The proposed algorithm is effective to calculate all attractors for large-scale Boolean gene regulatory networks even the networks with a relatively large average degree.}

Apart from the standard formulation all the formulations are `compact' in the sense that the number of constraints and variables is a polynomial function of the number of cities in the problem. Comparisons of the formulations are made by projecting out variables in order to produce polytopes in the same space. It is then possible to compare the strengths of the Linear Programming relaxations. These results are illustrated by computational results on a small problem},

  abstract = {{pystablemotifs is a Python 3 library for analyzing Boolean networks. Its non-heuristic and exhaustive attractor identification algorithm was previously presented in Rozum et al. (2021). Here, we illustrate its performance improvements over similar methods and discuss how it uses outputs of the attractor identification process to drive a system to one of its attractors from any initial state. We implement six attractor control algorithms, five of which are new in this work. By design, these algorithms can return different control strategies, allowing for synergistic use. We also give a brief overview of the other tools implemented in pystablemotifs.The source code is on GitHub at https://github.com/jcrozum/pystablemotifs/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

abstract = {Proto-organisms probably were randomly aggregated nets of chemical reactions. The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary “genes”. The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested.}

This will require computational models, whose predictive power is expected to increase with coverage and precision of formulation. Genome-scale models revolutionised the metabolic field and made the first whole-cell model possible. However, the lack of genome-scale models of signalling networks blocks the development of eukaryotic whole-cell models. Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic model of the molecular network that controls the cell division cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We use rxncon, the reaction-contingency language, to neutralise the scalability issues preventing formulation, visualisation and simulation of signalling networks at the genome-scale. We use parameter-free modelling to validate the network and to predict genotype-to-phenotype relationships down to residue resolution. This mechanistic genome-scale model offers a new perspective on eukaryotic cell cycle control, and opens up for similar models---and eventually whole-cell models---of human cells.},

abstract={Cellular decision-making is governed by molecular networks that are highly complex. An integrative understanding of these networks on a genome wide level is essential to understand cellular health and disease. In most cases however, such an understanding is beyond human comprehension and requires computational modeling. Mathematical modeling of biological networks at the level of biochemical details has hitherto relied on state transition models. These are typically based on enumeration of all relevant model states, and hence become very complex unless severely -- and often arbitrarily -- reduced. Furthermore, the parameters required for genome wide networks will remain underdetermined for the conceivable future. Alternatively, networks can be simulated by Boolean models, although these typically sacrifice molecular detail as well as distinction between different levels or modes of activity. However, the modeling community still lacks methods that can simulate genome scale networks on the level of biochemical reaction detail in a quantitative or semi quantitative manner.},

ABSTRACT={<p>The logical (or logic) formalism is increasingly used to model regulatory and signaling networks. Complementing these applications, several groups contributed various methods and tools to support the definition and analysis of logical models. After an introduction to the logical modeling framework and to several of its variants, we review here a number of recent methodological advances to ease the analysis of large and intricate networks. In particular, we survey approaches to determine model attractors and their reachability properties, to assess the dynamical impact of variations of external signals, and to consistently reduce large models. To illustrate these developments, we further consider several published logical models for two important biological processes, namely the differentiation of T helper cells and the control of mammalian cell cycle.</p>}}

	abstract = {Large-scale knowledge bases and models become increasingly important to systematise and interpret empirical knowledge on cellular systems. In signalling networks, as opposed to metabolic networks, distinct modifications of and bonds between components combine into very large numbers of possible configurations, or microstates. These are essentially never measured in vivo, making explicit modelling strategies both impractical and problematic. Here, we present rxncon 2.0, the second generation rxncon language, as a tool to define signal transduction networks at the level of empirical data. By expressing both reactions and contingencies (contextual constraints on reactions) in terms of elemental states, both the combinatorial complexity and the discrepancy to empirical data can be minimised. It works as a higher-level language natural to biologists, which can be compiled into a range of graphical formats or executable models. Taken together, the rxncon language combines mechanistic precision with scalability in a composable and compilable language, that is designed for building executable knowledge bases on the molecular biology of signalling systems.},

    abstract = "{Molecular interaction maps have emerged as a meaningful way of representing biological mechanisms in a comprehensive and systematic manner. However, their static nature provides limited insights to the emerging behaviour of the described biological system under different conditions. Computational modelling provides the means to study dynamic properties through in silico simulations and perturbations. We aim to bridge the gap between static and dynamic representations of biological systems with CaSQ, a software tool that infers Boolean rules based on the topology and semantics of molecular interaction maps built with CellDesigner.We developed CaSQ by defining conversion rules and logical formulas for inferred Boolean models according to the topology and the annotations of the starting molecular interaction maps. We used CaSQ to produce executable files of existing molecular maps that differ in size, complexity and the use of Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) standards. We also compared, where possible, the manually built logical models corresponding to a molecular map to the ones inferred by CaSQ. The tool is able to process large and complex maps built with CellDesigner (either following SBGN standards or not) and produce Boolean models in a standard output format, Systems Biology Marked Up Language-qualitative (SBML-qual), that can be further analyzed using popular modelling tools. References, annotations and layout of the CellDesigner molecular map are retained in the obtained model, facilitating interoperability and model reusability.The present tool is available online: https://lifeware.inria.fr/∼soliman/post/casq/ and distributed as a Python package under the GNU GPLv3 license.
